About:

This game simulates gameplay from the hit game franchise, Pokemon. Specifically,
it allows the player to attempt to catch Pokemon in the Safari Zone. The goal of the 
game is left up to the player, whether it's catching as much Pokemon as possible, or 
attempting the catch the strongest Pokemon out of the ones found, it's their 
decision to make. The player is given a set amount of Pokeballs each round, which is 
then used to attempt catching a Pokemon. Each Pokemon has a different catch rate, or the probability 
it will be caught, that will affect whether they can easily be caught or not. Pokemon with a 
catch rate of 0% are actually not impossible to catch, they simply have a very small 
catch rate that's close to 0. It will most likely take several attempts to catch these Pokemon. 

The game also allows the player to run away if they are not interested in catching a particular Pokemon 
that shows up. 

At the end of the game, the program will display a list of the Pokemon that were caught during the 
adventure. 

Good luck and have fun!
